You can\r\nenable this mode with -w, which will print warnings of anything it finds.  It's\r\na sort of lint for gedcom files.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n    gedcal -dawl gedcom-file.ged > /dev/null\r\n\r\nYou can create a month-to-a-page calendar:\r\n\r\n    gedcal -dlHh 'Your Full Name' gedcom-file.ged > calendar.html\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
